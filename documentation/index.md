The Silver documentation is currently being migrated from its original
wiki on is previous Google Code site, but most of it is in place and
this is the best source for learning how to use Silver.

Below are some pointers to help you find your way through the
documentation. 

* The [installation guide](silver/doc/instal-guide) and [command line
  reference](silver/doc/command-line-reference) will get you started
  with Silver.

* The [tutorial (TODO)](silver/doc/tutorial) provies a gentle
  introduction to attribute grammars generally and Silver
  specifically.  If you are familiar with the attribute grammar
  formalism you may want to just skim this.
